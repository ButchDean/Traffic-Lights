# Traffic Signals with Pedestrian Signals

## What is it?

Traffic signals with a feature for pedestrians: 'D' is 'Don't Walk', and 'W' is 'Walk'.

## What you will need

It is advised at the very least that you use Visual Studio Community on Windows 8.1 and up, but you are free to use whichever IDE you wish.

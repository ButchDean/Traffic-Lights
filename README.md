#Traffic Lights Challenge with Pedestrians

##Introduction

Following on from the last challenge, Traffic Lights, in this challenge you are to add a feature for pedestrians as demonstrated in this executable. 'D' is 'Don't Walk', and 'W' is 'Walk'.

##What you will need

It is advised at the very least that you use either Visual C++ 2008/2010 Express Editions. You are free to use whichever IDE you wish.

##What is provided

Please build on the completed code for the last challenge to implement this extra feature. It is up to you, either as a group or indivdually (not recommended), on the appropriate implementation.

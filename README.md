#Traffic Lights Challenge

##Introduction

Game programming is a lot more than graphics, IO and collision detection - it's also about getting subsystems to communicate and work in harmony. This small challenge, which appears deceptively simple, employs a traffic light system that is found in games like Grand Theft Auto and LA Noire for example.
The goal os this exercise is to debug and complete the code, implementing the various methods to get is working as per the exectable contained in TrafficLights.zip in the Traffic-Lights Github repository here.

##What you will need

The code was written using Vusual Studio 2008 Pro, and it is advised at the very least that you use either Visual C++ 2008/2010 Express Editions. You are free to use whichever IDE you wish, but if it breaks I won't be any help - I'll just say 'use Visual C++ Express'.
This is a console application not needing any special APIs or SDKs. My reason for this is that I would prefer people to focus on the logic over making it look pretty.

##What is provided

I have written the code and deleted nearly all method implemetations and introduced errors. It is up to you, either as a group to share ideas on this thread (recommended) or indivdually (not recommended), on the appropriate implementation. The class declarations should not be altered.
All methods and variables declarations have been left in place in order to complete the code, but if you feel you cannot work out the logic to use what is provided then I will allow you to modify as appropriate. Before you do, it might be an idea to post your thoughts on this thread to see what others might think to avoid coming up with a lesser solution.

##The Solution

This used to be in its own repo, but I opted to move it to the 'TrafficLightsComplete' branch of this repo. Be sure to have fun before peeking at this branch!
